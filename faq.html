            <span>Is franchise business profitable in India?</span>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <div class="faq-answer-inner">
              <p>Yes — if chosen and operated correctly. Profitability depends on the right brand + right market + efficient operations. Many franchisees struggle due to poor fit, unrealistic expectations, or weak research. That's why profitability is decided at the selection stage, not after opening. Our ROI-based evaluation ensures you invest in opportunities with realistic and sustainable returns.</p>

              <p>Businesses under ₹10 Lakhs typically include kiosk or compact retail formats, distribution & dealership models, service-based businesses, small F&B takeaway formats, and education support services. While entry cost is lower, profitability depends on local demand and cost management. We help evaluate which low-investment options are genuinely viable for your city and involvement capacity.</p>

              <p>The most common mistakes include: believing marketing promises without verification, ignoring working capital requirements, choosing the wrong location, underestimating personal involvement needed, selecting a brand with weak post-sale support, and not seeking professional advice.

              <p>Unlike listing platforms that simply display franchise options, we are <strong>franchise strategists and advisors</strong>. We don't sell franchises — we help you choose the right one. Our differences: strategy-first assessment vs. random listings, data-driven evaluation vs. advertiser-paid placement, personalized recommendations vs. generic catalogs, and end-to-end advisory vs. just lead generation. Think of us as franchise consultants, not a marketplace.</p>

              <p>Location is one of the biggest determinants of franchise success. Even strong brands can fail in weak locations. We evaluate footfall patterns, catchment area demographics, local competition, and affordability metrics before recommending any location. Our market planning service ensures you don't just pick a franchise — you pick the right place for it.</p>
