            What exactly does MakeMyFranchise do?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>MakeMyFranchise is a franchise advisory and matchmaking platform. Unlike portals that list brands and earn commissions for every referral, we work as your strategic advisor. We profile your budget, city, experience and goals &mdash; then recommend franchises that genuinely match your profile. We also help brands expand responsibly by qualifying investors before introductions. We guide you from discovery to documentation to launch.</p>

            What is the difference between a franchise advisor and a franchise broker?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>A franchise broker earns commission from brands for every investor they send &mdash; which creates an obvious conflict of interest. They push whoever pays the highest commission, not what suits you best. A franchise advisor like MakeMyFranchise earns your trust by recommending what genuinely fits your profile. We evaluate options based on your budget, city demand, operational capacity and risk appetite &mdash; not based on who pays us more. This difference can save you lakhs and years of struggle.</p>

            Is franchise business profitable in India?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes &mdash; if chosen and operated correctly. Strong brands combined with the right market and efficient operations can deliver good returns. However, many investors struggle because they choose based on hype rather than feasibility, underestimate working capital, or select wrong locations. The key insight from our advisory experience is this: profitability is largely decided at the selection stage, not after opening. Choose right, and the odds are significantly in your favour.</p>

            How much investment is required to start a franchise?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Franchise investments in India can start from under &#8377;5 lakhs for small service models and go up to several crores for premium formats. Most good franchise opportunities are available in the &#8377;10&ndash;50 lakh range. However, the important number is not just the franchise fee &mdash; it is the total investment including setup, equipment, licensing, working capital for 3&ndash;6 months and local marketing. We help you build a realistic total cost picture before you commit.</p>

            Which sector gives the fastest break-even?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>There is no universal answer &mdash; break-even depends on rent, demand, pricing, management efficiency and competitive landscape. Be very cautious of any advisor who guarantees specific timelines. In our experience, well-chosen and well-operated food businesses can break even in 12&ndash;18 months; salon and wellness businesses in 10&ndash;18 months; education businesses in 12&ndash;24 months. We help you model realistic scenarios for your specific city and investment amount.</p>

            What are the biggest mistakes first-time franchise investors make?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The five biggest mistakes we see repeatedly: (1) Choosing based on brand hype and social media rather than unit economics. (2) Ignoring working capital needs &mdash; most budget only for setup. (3) Poor location selection based on affordability of rent rather than footfall analysis. (4) Underestimating operational involvement &mdash; assuming it&rsquo;s passive when it requires full-time attention initially. (5) Not getting professional advice before investing. All five are preventable with proper due diligence.</p>

            Food franchise vs salon franchise &mdash; which is better?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Neither is universally better &mdash; they suit different investors. Food businesses have higher transaction volume but tighter margins, greater operational complexity and extreme location sensitivity. Salon businesses have more predictable billing, repeat customers and structured appointments but rely heavily on stylist retention. Choose food if you enjoy fast-paced daily operations. Choose salon if you prefer structured, relationship-driven business. We recommend based on your actual profile, not trends.</p>

            How does MakeMyFranchise evaluate whether a franchise is right for me?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We use our proprietary Suitability Score System &mdash; a weighted scoring model across 7 parameters: budget match (25%), city potential (15%), experience fit (15%), industry interest (15%), risk appetite (10%), time involvement (10%) and scale ambition (10%). Each parameter is rated 1&ndash;10, multiplied by its weight, and summed to give a score out of 10. This tells you not whether a brand is good &mdash; but whether it is good for YOU.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">
            How important is location for franchise success?
            <i data-lucide="chevron-down"></i>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Critically important. Even strong national brands fail in weak locations. We evaluate footfall, catchment area demographics, proximity to competition, affordability of your target customers and the rent-to-revenue ratio before recommending any location. A &#8377;1 lakh monthly rent that generates &#8377;7 lakh revenue is not the same proposition as the same rent generating &#8377;3 lakh revenue. Location is where many franchise investments win or lose.</p>
