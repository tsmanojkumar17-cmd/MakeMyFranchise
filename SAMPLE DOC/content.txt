📝 ARTICLE 1
Best Franchise Under ₹10 Lakhs in India (2026 Guide)
Introduction
Starting a business no longer requires crores of investment. Today, several franchise models allow aspiring entrepreneurs to enter proven industries with manageable capital and structured support.
However, the biggest challenge is not finding options — it is choosing the right franchise that matches your budget, city potential, and operational capability.
This is where most investors make mistakes.
At MakeMyFranchise, we help entrepreneurs evaluate franchise opportunities using a strategic, data-backed approach — ensuring decisions are practical, not emotional.
 
What Can You Expect Under ₹10 Lakhs?
Typically, businesses in this range fall into:
•	Kiosk or compact retail formats
•	Distribution & dealership models
•	Service-based businesses
•	Small F&B takeaway formats
•	Education support services
While entry cost is lower, profitability depends heavily on local demand and cost management.
 
Key Risks Investors Often Miss
Many people jump into franchising because the entry is affordable. But low investment does not mean low risk.
Common mistakes include:
• Selecting a brand with weak support
• Ignoring royalty structures
• Overestimating footfall
• Not understanding working capital needs
• Entering overcrowded markets
 
What Actually Makes a Small Franchise Successful?
From our advisory experience, success usually depends on:
✔ Right location economics
✔ Realistic break-even expectations
✔ Operational involvement
✔ Brand strength in your region
✔ Unit-level profitability, not brand popularity
 
How MakeMyFranchise Helps
Instead of pushing random brands, we:
✅ Understand your investor profile
✅ Study your city potential
✅ Compare multiple options
✅ Evaluate ROI feasibility
✅ Connect you with suitable brands
We ensure you invest in something that can sustain, not just start.
 
Who Is Ideal for This Budget?
This range works best for:
•	First-time entrepreneurs
•	Families entering business
•	Professionals seeking side income
•	Investors testing entrepreneurship
 
Conclusion
A ₹10 lakh investment can become a strong stepping stone if chosen wisely.
The difference between success and struggle is usually expert evaluation.

ARTICLE 2
Salon vs Food Franchise – Which Business Is Better for You?
Introduction
Two of the most popular franchise sectors in India are Salon & Wellness and Food & Beverage.
Both promise strong demand.
Both show attractive success stories.
But they are very different businesses.
Choosing the wrong one for your personality, budget, or market can create long-term stress.
 
Investment Comparison
Food businesses often require:
•	Kitchen setup
•	Equipment
•	Higher manpower
•	Licenses
•	High rentals
Salon businesses usually need:
•	Interiors & chairs
•	Skilled staff
•	Moderate inventory
•	Strong service consistency
 
Operational Complexity
Food = daily inventory, wastage control, hygiene monitoring, reviews.
Salon = staff management, repeat customers, service quality.
 
Profit Style Difference
Food may give higher volumes but tighter margins.
Salon may give repeat customers and stable billing.
 
Market Sensitivity
Food businesses are more vulnerable to:
• Competition
• Online delivery ratings
• Changing tastes
Salons depend on:
• Local branding
• Customer loyalty
• Stylist retention
 
Which One Suits You?
Choose Food if:
✔ You like fast-paced operations
✔ You can handle daily supervision
✔ You enjoy customer service environment
Choose Salon if:
✔ You prefer structured appointments
✔ You focus on long-term clients
✔ You want predictable billing
 
Where Most Investors Go Wrong
They choose based on:
❌ brand hype
❌ social media
❌ what friends suggest
Not based on financial and personal fit.
 
How MakeMyFranchise Solves This
We evaluate:
✅ your capital
✅ involvement capacity
✅ city demand
✅ risk appetite
✅ break-even comfort
Then recommend what suits you, not the market trend.
 
Conclusion
There is no “best” franchise.
There is only the best franchise for YOU.

1️⃣ ✅ HOW TO CALCULATE SUITABILITY SCORE
You score across weighted dimensions.
Example master parameters:
Parameter	Weight
Budget match	25%
City potential	15%
Experience fit	15%
Time involvement	10%
Risk appetite	10%
Industry interest	15%
Scale ambition	10%
Total = 100%
 
Step 1
Rate each parameter from 1 to 10.
Step 2
Multiply by weight.
Step 3
Add them → Final score out of 10.
 
Example
Budget match = 8 → 8 × 25% = 2
City = 7 → 7 × 15% = 1.05
Total → 7.3/10
 
 
2️⃣ ✅ EXCEL LOGIC FOR RATING
Assume:
Column	Meaning
A	Budget
B	City
C	Experience
D	Time
E	Risk
F	Industry
G	Scale
 
Formula
= (A2*25% + B2*15% + C2*15% + D2*10% + E2*10% + F2*15% + G2*10%)
 
Automatic Grade
=IF(H2>=8,"Excellent",IF(H2>=6,"Good","Needs Review"))
 
This lets consultants instantly judge.
 
 
3️⃣ ✅ AI RECOMMENDATION FORMULA (Future Ready)
When you grow, AI can learn from:
✔ closed deals
✔ failed deals
✔ investor satisfaction
✔ profitability outcomes
 
Basic Rule Engine (starting point)
IF:
•	Budget within range
•	city viable
•	risk aligned
→ recommend.
 
Advanced (machine learning style)
Score =
(W1 × Budget Fit) +
(W2 × Demand Probability) +
(W3 × Operator Success History) +
(W4 × Similar Investor Success)
 
Over time AI becomes smarter.

Preference
•	industries interested
•	brand vs profit priority
 
Risk
•	safe & steady / aggressive growth?
 
Vision
•	single unit or multi-unit?
 
This becomes your matchmaking DNA.
